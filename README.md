Getting the data from Sql Server and analysing in PowerBI

The Awesome Chocolates company dataset is residing in SQL Server. They want to analyse the data for there sales and the end user only wants the dashboard to show the statistics of the required Product using there ID's. Whenever there is a requirement for creating the sales report of a particular product, we can got to power query and use dynamic filtering option to fetch only the required product sales data from the SQL Server thus reducing the load on PowerBI.

The key analysis for the product includes:
The total sales , total boxes shipped, total shipment, and the percent of the low box shipped (shipment of boxes < 50)
The sales trend over years and by country. The product name and the product id will be automatically showed in the report which is created.
